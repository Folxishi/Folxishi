Hello there, Folxshi here in the land of the internet. I'm just a normal person, nothing out of the ordinary here! Or perhaps, those who insist on being called ordinary are in fact the least ordinary of them all? In which case am I actually pressing my abnormality instead? But there are so many who present themselves as "weird" and not like other people, that it is normal for them to do so - is there really such a thing as a normal or abnormal human? I believe not, though it could be said that since everyone is different, then being different is normal, and thus everyone is normal; or perhaps being abnormal, is normal? I don't know, what am I talking about?
